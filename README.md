Functionality - 4
I completed all of the required functionality (Enigma class, encrypt, decrypt, and command line interface). I also have a functional cracking method.


Object oriented programming - 3 
I think that my object oriented programming score is a 3. I started with much larger methods, and then created helper methods to pull out redundant code. I considered breaking my program up into multiple classes, but I eventually decided to leave them in the enigma class. 

To be clear, my crack method is extremely long, but this was the last thing that I did, and I ran out of time to refactor this method. Outside of this, the enigma class is only about 115 lines long - my assumption was that the length of the crack method wouldn't be held against me, since it was optional. 


Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3 
I belive this score should be a 3. My methods were too long for a 4, but I think that I used data structures and enumerables efficiently. I used a hash in several methods for a return statement.


Test Driven Development - 3
I tested all of my methods, with the exception of the ones that require user input or have random input. I used TDD, writing tests first, and tested edge cases. My test coverage is 100% 


Other notes:
I had more than 30 commits, and used pull requests from several branches to merge code to main. I added new branches sequentially as I worked through the different phases of the project
