Functionality - 4

I completed all of the required functionality (Enigma class, encrypt, decrypt, and command line interface). I also have a functional cracking method.


Object oriented programming - 4

I think that my object oriented programming score is a 4. I started with much larger methods, and then created helper methods to pull out redundant code. I moved these helper methods to two modules, one for the crack method, and another for the other methods. I think the modules help emphasize the helper methods vs the methods that are actually called. 

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3 

I belive this score should be a 3. My methods were too long for a 4, but other than that, my code is properly indented and spaced, and lines aren't too long typically. I think that I used data structures and enumerables efficiently, and I used several hashes. 


Test Driven Development - 3

I tested all of my methods, with the exception of the ones that require user input or have random input. I used TDD, writing tests first, and tested edge cases. My test coverage is 100% 


Other notes:
I had more than 30 commits, and used pull requests from several branches to merge code to main. I added new branches sequentially as I worked through the different phases of the project
